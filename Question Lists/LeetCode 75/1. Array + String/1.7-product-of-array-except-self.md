https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

#### What I learned
We can reduce the space complexity from O(n) to O(1) (excluding the returned array) by adding the prefix products to the results array first and then finding the product of prefix and postfix arrays in place. In my first solution, I created 3 arrays that could be reduced to 1. 

There's an Array.Fill method if I need. 

#### Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n) due to linear searching over nums array and my results array. 

- Space complexity:
O(1) in the LLM solution due to adding products to results array in place

#### My Solution

```c#
public class Solution {
    public int[] ProductExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int[] prefixes = new int[nums.Length];
        int[] postfixes = new int[nums.Length];
        Array.Fill(prefixes, 1);
        Array.Fill(postfixes, 1);

        int product = nums[0];
        for (int i=1; i<nums.Length; i++)
        {
            prefixes[i] = product;
            product *= nums[i];
        }

        product = nums[nums.Length-1];
        for (int i=nums.Length-2; i>=0; i--)
        {
            postfixes[i] = product;
            product *= nums[i];
        }

        int[] results = new int[nums.Length];
        for (int i=0; i<nums.Length; i++)
        {
            results[i] = prefixes[i] * postfixes[i];
        }

        return results;
    }
}
```

#### LLM Optimization

Sure, I can help optimize this code. The current implementation uses three separate arrays: `prefixes`, `postfixes`, and `results`. However, we can reduce the space complexity to O(1) by using only the `results` array and a single variable to keep track of the running product from the right. Here's the optimized code:

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public int[] ProductExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int length = nums.Length;
        int[] results = new int[length];

        // Calculate the left product for each position
        results[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {
            results[i] = nums[i - 1] * results[i - 1];
        }

        // Calculate the right product for each position
        int rightProduct = 1;
        for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            results[i] *= rightProduct;
            rightProduct *= nums[i];
        }

        return results;
    }
}
```

This optimized code does exactly the same thing as the original code but uses less space. It first calculates the product of all the numbers to the left of each position and stores it in the `results` array. Then it calculates the product of all the numbers to the right of each position and multiplies it with the left product stored in the `results` array. The final `results` array contains the product of all numbers except the number at each position. This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) (excluding the output array), where n is the length of the input array.
