#### What I learned
There are string split options for removing empty values when converting a string to an array. This functionality removes the need to add additional iterations for removing empty values.

Arrays can have values reversed, just like with other languages.

#### Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n) due to iterating over words in the string.

- Space complexity:
O(n) due to extra space for creating an array.

#### My Solution
```c#
public class Solution {
    public string ReverseWords(string s) {
        // slit the string by blank space characters - note: there will be empty array values
        string[] words = s.Split(" ");
        int leftPointer = 0;
        int rightPointer = words.Length-1;

        while (leftPointer < rightPointer)
        {
            string leftWord = words[leftPointer];
            string rightWord = words[rightPointer];
            if (leftWord.Length != 0 && rightWord.Length != 0)
            {
                words[leftPointer] = rightWord;
                words[rightPointer] = leftWord;

                leftPointer++;
                rightPointer--;
            } else
            {
                if (leftWord.Length == 0)
                {
                    leftPointer++;
                }

                if (rightWord.Length == 0)
                {
                    rightPointer--;
                }
            }
        }

        string result = "";
        for (int i=0; i<words.Length; i++)
        {
            if (words[i].Length != 0)
            {
                result += $" {words[i]}";
            }
        }

        return result.Trim();
    }
}
```

#### LLM Optimization
Sure, I can help optimize this code. Here's a more efficient version:

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public string ReverseWords(string s) {
        // Split the string by blank space characters and remove empty entries
        string[] words = s.Split(new[] { ' ' }, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);

        // Reverse the array in-place
        Array.Reverse(words);

        // Join the words with a space and return the result
        return string.Join(" ", words);
    }
}
```

This version of the function does the following:
- It splits the input string into words, but it uses the `StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries` option to automatically remove empty entries. This eliminates the need for the loop that skips over empty words in the original code.
- It uses the `Array.Reverse` method to reverse the order of the words in-place. This is more efficient than manually swapping the words using a pair of pointers.
- Finally, it uses the `string.Join` method to concatenate the words into a single string with spaces in between. This is more efficient than manually appending each word to the result string with a space in front, and it also eliminates the need to trim the result string at the end. 

This optimized version should have the same functionality as the original code, but it's simpler and more efficient. It should run faster, especially for large input strings, and it uses less memory. It also takes advantage of built-in .NET methods for common operations, which often have optimized implementations.
