#### Problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

#### What I learned
I should consider using a hashset when creating a lookup method like isVowel. Copilot thinks isVowel is an O(n) operation, however the number of vowels is constant.'
It is a more optimized solution to use a hashset.

#### Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n) because at worst case I need to swap every letter. I'm only iterating over half the characters in a string, but that still rounds up to O(n) when I remove the constants O(n*1/2).

- Space complexity:
O(n) because I'm not modifying the string in place. 

#### My Solution
```c#
public class Solution {
    private bool isVowel(char c)
    {
        switch (Char.ToLower(c))
        {
            case 'a':
            case 'e':
            case 'i':
            case 'o':
            case 'u':
                return true;
            default:
                return false;
        }
    }

    public string ReverseVowels(string s) {
        char[] resultArray = s.ToCharArray(); 

        int leftPointer = 0;
        int rightPointer = s.Length-1;
        while (leftPointer < rightPointer)
        {
            char leftChar = s[leftPointer];
            char rightChar = s[rightPointer];
            if (isVowel(leftChar) && isVowel(rightChar))
            {
                resultArray[leftPointer] = rightChar;
                resultArray[rightPointer] = leftChar;

                leftPointer++;
                rightPointer--;
            } else 
            {
                if (!isVowel(leftChar))
                {
                    leftPointer++;
                }

                if (!isVowel(rightChar))
                {
                    rightPointer--;
                }
            }
        } 

        return new String(resultArray);
    }
}
```

#### LLM Optimization
Sure, I can help optimize this code. One way to optimize it is by using a `HashSet` for vowel checking instead of the `switch` statement. This reduces the time complexity from O(n) to O(1) for the vowel checking operation. Here's the optimized code:

```csharp
public class Solution {
    private HashSet<char> vowels = new HashSet<char> {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'};

    public string ReverseVowels(string s) {
        char[] resultArray = s.ToCharArray(); 

        int leftPointer = 0;
        int rightPointer = s.Length-1;
        while (leftPointer < rightPointer)
        {
            char leftChar = s[leftPointer];
            char rightChar = s[rightPointer];
            if (vowels.Contains(leftChar) && vowels.Contains(rightChar))
            {
                resultArray[leftPointer] = rightChar;
                resultArray[rightPointer] = leftChar;

                leftPointer++;
                rightPointer--;
            } else 
            {
                if (!vowels.Contains(leftChar))
                {
                    leftPointer++;
                }

                if (!vowels.Contains(rightChar))
                {
                    rightPointer--;
                }
            }
        } 

        return new String(resultArray);
    }
}
```
This code does the same thing as your original code, but it should be faster because checking whether a character is a vowel is now a constant time operation. The `HashSet` `vowels` contains all the vowels in both lower case and upper case, so there's no need to convert the characters to lower case before checking. This should make the `ReverseVowels` function more efficient.

Me: explain to me why the isVowel method is an O(n) method with a switch statement

CoPilot: 
The `isVowel` method is considered to have a time complexity of O(n) because in the worst-case scenario, it could potentially go through all the cases in the `switch` statement before finding a match or returning `false`. 

In your `isVowel` method, the `switch` statement checks each vowel one by one. If the character is 'u' or not a vowel, it would have to check all the cases, making it an O(n) operation, where n is the number of cases in the `switch` statement.

However, it's important to note that in this context, n is a small constant (5 vowels), so the practical impact on performance is minimal. The O(n) notation is more relevant when n can grow large with the size of the input, which is not the case here.

The optimization using a `HashSet` is technically also O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `HashSet`, but since a `HashSet` uses hashing for its operations, the time complexity for search operations (like `Contains`) is generally considered to be O(1), or constant time, because it doesn't grow with the size of the set. This is why the `HashSet` approach can be considered more efficient.
