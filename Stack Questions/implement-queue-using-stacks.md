#### What I learned

Having two stacks reduces the complexity to O(1) ammortized time. I've learned about ammortization in my ds and algs course in University, but again recalling it now. Amortization is spreading out the 'cost' of opperations over a sequence of opperations. Ammortization is basically an average complexity. 

#### Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(1) for Push and Empty
O(n) for Pop and Peek, however could be optimized to O(1) Ammortized.

- Space complexity:
O(n) due to iterating through stacks

#### My Solution
```c#
public class MyQueue {
    Stack<int> _queue;

    public MyQueue() {
        _queue = new Stack<int>();
    }
    
    public void Push(int x) {
        _queue.Push(x);
    }
    
    public int Pop() {
        var tempStack = new Stack<int>();

        while(_queue.Count != 0)
        {
            int item = _queue.Pop();
            tempStack.Push(item);
        }

        int firstItem = tempStack.Pop();

        while(tempStack.Count != 0)
        {
            int item = tempStack.Pop();
            _queue.Push(item);
        }

        return firstItem;
    }
    
    public int Peek() {
        var tempStack = new Stack<int>();

        while(_queue.Count != 0)
        {
            int item = _queue.Pop();
            tempStack.Push(item);
        }

        int firstItem = tempStack.Peek();

        while(tempStack.Count != 0)
        {
            int item = tempStack.Pop();
            _queue.Push(item);
        }

        return firstItem;
    }
    
    public bool Empty() {
        if (_queue.Count == 0) 
        {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }
}

/**
 * Your MyQueue object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyQueue obj = new MyQueue();
 * obj.Push(x);
 * int param_2 = obj.Pop();
 * int param_3 = obj.Peek();
 * bool param_4 = obj.Empty();
 */
```

#### LLM Optimization
Sure, I can help optimize this code. Here's an optimized version of your code:

```csharp
public class MyQueue {
    Stack<int> input;
    Stack<int> output;

    public MyQueue() {
        input = new Stack<int>();
        output = new Stack<int>();
    }
    
    public void Push(int x) {
        input.Push(x);
    }
    
    public int Pop() {
        Peek();
        return output.Pop();
    }
    
    public int Peek() {
        if (output.Count == 0) {
            while (input.Count != 0) {
                output.Push(input.Pop());
            }
        }
        return output.Peek();
    }
    
    public bool Empty() {
        return input.Count == 0 && output.Count == 0;
    }
}
```

Here are the optimizations I made:
- I used two stacks, `input` and `output`, to implement the queue. The `input` stack is used for the `Push` operation and the `output` stack is used for the `Pop` and `Peek` operations.
- In the `Push` method, I simply push the element into the `input` stack.
- In the `Pop` and `Peek` methods, if the `output` stack is empty, I pop all elements from the `input` stack and push them into the `output` stack. This way, the order of the elements is reversed in the `output` stack and the oldest element is on the top, which is what we want for a queue.
- The `Empty` method checks if both the `input` and `output` stacks are empty.
- This approach avoids the need to move elements back and forth between two stacks for every `Pop` or `Peek` operation, which improves the time complexity.
